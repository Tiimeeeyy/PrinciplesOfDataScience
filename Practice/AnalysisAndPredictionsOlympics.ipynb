    "# Data Science Project Based on `games` and `regions` CSV Files\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing (1 hour)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check for missing values in both DataFrames. If there are any, decide on a strategy to handle them (e.g., remove rows, fill with mean, etc.).\n",
    "- Check for duplicate rows in both DataFrames. If there are any, remove them.\n",
    "- Perform any necessary type conversions (e.g., converting strings to integers, dates to datetime objects, etc.).\n",
    "- Perform feature scaling if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (2 hours)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find the number of unique regions in the `regions` DataFrame.\n",
    "- Find the number of unique games in the `games` DataFrame.\n",
    "- Find the game with the most athletes participating, based on the `games` DataFrame.\n",
    "- Use seaborn or matplotlib to visualize the data in a meaningful way (e.g., distribution of games per region, number of athletes per game, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Feature Engineering (2 hours)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Based on your exploratory data analysis, decide on which features could be important for your model.\n",
    "- Create new features if necessary (e.g., total number of games per region, average number of athletes per game, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Model Building (3 hours)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Merge the `games` and `regions` DataFrames on the appropriate column(s).\n",
    "- Split the data into a training set and a test set.\n",
    "- Choose a suitable model (e.g., linear regression, decision tree, random forest, etc.) and train it on your training set.\n",
    "- Evaluate the model on the test set using appropriate metrics (e.g., mean squared error, accuracy, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Model Tuning (2 hours)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use techniques like cross-validation, grid search, or random search to tune your model's hyperparameters.\n",
    "- Evaluate the tuned model on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Reporting (1 hour)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Summarize your findings in a report. Include visualizations, model performance metrics, and any insights you gained from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to use the libraries you've imported (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, and `sklearn`) where appropriate. You may also want to consider using additional libraries like `seaborn` for visualization, `scipy` for statistical analysis, and `joblib` for saving and loading models."
